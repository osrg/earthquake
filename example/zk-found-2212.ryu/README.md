# ZooKeeper Bug [ZOOKEEPER-2212](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2212): distributed race condition related to QV version

When a joiner is listed as an observer in an initial config,
the joiner should become a non-voting follower (not an observer) until reconfig is triggered. [(Link)](http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/trunk/zookeeperReconfig.html#sc_reconfig_general)

We found a race-condition situation where an observer keeps being an observer and cannot become a non-voting follower.

This race condition happens when an observer receives an `UPTODATE` Quorum Packet from the leader:2888/tcp *after* receiving a `Notification` FLE Packet of which n.config version is larger than the observer's one from leader:3888/tcp.

## ZooKeeper Version
[commit 98a3cabfa279833b81908d72f1c10ee9f598a045 (Tue Jun 2 19:17:09 2015 +0000)](https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/commit/98a3cabfa279833b81908d72f1c10ee9f598a045)

NOTE: We reported the bug ([ZOOKEEPER-2212](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2212)) to ZooKeeper community, and the bug is fixed in [commit ec056d3c3a18b862d0cd83296b7d4319652b0b1c (Mon Jun 15 23:05:25 2015 +0000)](https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/commit/ec056d3c3a18b862d0cd83296b7d4319652b0b1c).

## Details
 * Problem: An observer cannot become a non-voting follower
 * Cause: Cannot restart FLE
 * Cause: In QuorumPeer.run(), cannot shutdown Observer [(Link)](https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/98a3cabfa279833b81908d72f1c10ee9f598a045/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/QuorumPeer.java#L1014)
 * Cause: In QuorumPeer.run(), cannot return from Observer.observeLeader()  [(Link)](https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/98a3cabfa279833b81908d72f1c10ee9f598a045/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/QuorumPeer.java#L1010)
 * Cause: In Observer.observeLeader(), Learner.syncWithLeader() does not throw an exception of "changes proposed in reconfig" [(Link)](https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/98a3cabfa279833b81908d72f1c10ee9f598a045/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/Observer.java#L79)
 * Cause: In Learner.syncWithLeader(), QuorumPeer.processReconfig() returns false with a log message like "2 setQuorumVerifier called with known or old config 4294967296. Current version: 4294967296".
 * Cause: The observer have already received a Notification Packet(n.config.version=4294967296), invoked QuorumPeer.processReconfig() [(Link)](https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/98a3cabfa279833b81908d72f1c10ee9f598a045/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/FastLeaderElection.java#L291-304)
   

## How to Reproduce the Bug with Namazu
    
### Start Namazu
Please see [../../doc/how-to-setup-env.md](../../doc/how-to-setup-env.md) for how to setup the environment.

The pre-built Docker image (`osrg/namazu`) is strongly recommended, 
because `ovsbr0` is expected to be configured as `192.168.42.254/24` in the experiments.

NOTE: If git master version is corrupted, you can use [osrg/earthquake-zookeeper-2212](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/osrg/earthquake-zookeeper-2212/) container (based on Namazu v0.1).
