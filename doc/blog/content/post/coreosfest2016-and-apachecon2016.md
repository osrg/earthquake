Note: we recently renamed _Earthquake_ to _Namazu_.

Last week we had presentations at two events: [CoreOS Fest](http://sched.co/6Szb) (May 10) and [ApacheCon Core NA](http://sched.co/6OJU) (May 12).

Thank you all for attending our presentations and discussing with us!

## Related work
At events, we found two projects related to our work: [Runway](http://sched.co/6T0X) (by Diego Ongaro, Salesforce, at CoreOS Fest) and [dist_test](http://sched.co/6M0A) (by Andrew Wang, Cloudera, at ApacheCon).

We'll be watching these projects.
